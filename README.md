# Wyngine
Yet another 2D game engine for Kha.

This is intended as an experimental, learning experience for me. I'm building and adding features as I require them. The code base is influenced by HaxePunk and HaxeFlixel, because I'm still learning. Ultimately I hope it'll evolve into a usable game engine alternative for Kha.

The current philosphy I'm trying to follow for the engine is: "If it's fancy, then we probably don't need it (yet)."

The API may change drastically as I learn new techs and apply them into the overall structure of the engine. Please use at your own risk! When the engine is ready, you will see a "Getting Started" section below. If not, please be patient :)
